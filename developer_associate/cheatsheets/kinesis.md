# kinesis

- the AWS solution for collecting, processing and analyzing streaming data in the cloud --- when you need **real time** think Kinesis
- 4 types of streams
  - kinesis data streams
    - pay per shard that is running
    - data can persist within the stream
    - data is orderedc and every consumer keeps its own position
    - consumers have to be manually added (coded)
    - data persist for 24 hours (default) to 168 hours
  - kinesis firehose
    - pay for only the data ingested
    - data immediately dissappers once processed
    - consumer of choice is from a predefined set of services
      - S3
      - Redshift
      - Elasticsearch
      - Splunk
  - kinesis data analytics
    - alows you to perform queries in real time
    - needs a kinesis data stream/firehouse as input and output
  - kinesis video analytics
    - securely ingests and stores video and audio encoded data to consumers such as SageMaker, Rekognition or other servics to apply Machine learning and video processing
  - KPL **Kinesis Producer Library** is a Java library to write data to a stream
  - you can write data to stream using AWS SDK, but KPL is more efficient
